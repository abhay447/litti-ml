Litti-ML is an extensible ML inference engine, which natively understands model and feature metadata in inference
context.

## Goals:

1. Define specifications and add examples for multi-framework inference support for most jvm based frameworks.
2. Define specifications and add examples for multi-framework inference support for non-jvm based frameworks.
3. Define specifications for an extensible integration of inference feature stores.
4. Define specifications for model and feature store inference telemetry for platform engineers.
